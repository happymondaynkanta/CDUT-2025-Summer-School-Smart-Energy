## 📘 About This Series

This course offers a 14-day deep dive into Machine Learning (ML) and Explainable AI (XAI) using real-world energy datasets. By the end of the program, learners will:

- Train and explain high-performance ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)
- Visualize predictions with interactive Streamlit dashboards
- Understand SHAP values for model transparency
- Deploy secure AI apps with Supabase authentication
